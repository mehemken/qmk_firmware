# The default Preonic layout - largely based on the Planck's

I've switched around the ESC and CTRL keys to my liking. This needs to be tested.

## Interesting layers

- Blake Newman has a nice looking numpad layer. Check that one out.
- Choromanski also has an intersting numpad + mouse layer.
- dudeofawesome also has an intersting numpad layer.

## Interesting keys

- the `ekis_isa` QWERTY uses the `KC_GESC` key:
  Escape when tapped, ` when pressed with Shift or GUI
  I like that. It allows the keyboard to have two control keys; the normal one and the one that replaces caps lock.

## To do

- Add a numpad layer
