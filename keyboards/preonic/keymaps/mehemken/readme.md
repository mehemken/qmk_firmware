# The default Preonic layout - largely based on the Planck's

I've switched around the ESC and CTRL keys to my liking. This needs to be tested.

## Interesting layers

- Blake Newman has a nice looking numpad layer. Check that one out.
- Choromanski also has an intersting numpad + mouse layer.
  Actually, Choromanski doesn't have a full space key... so no.
- dudeofawesome also has an intersting numpad layer.

## Interesting keys

- the `ekis_isa` QWERTY uses the `KC_GESC` key:
  Escape when tapped, \` when pressed with Shift or GUI
  I like that. It allows the keyboard to have two control keys; the normal one and the one that replaces caps lock.
- muzfuz has an `ESC_CTL` key that he defined like so:
  `#define ESC_CTL CTL_T(KC_ESCAPE)`
- spacebarracecar her own `spacebarracecar.h` file in the `users` directory.
  Also has a Navigation layer with home, end, pageup, pagedown keys.
- zach also has his own functions in a separate file. It looks like he
  definitely spends time adjusting his keyboard because he removed the ascii
  rendering of the keys altogether. Makes sense... updating both is a bit
  tedious.

## To do

- Add a numpad layer
- What to do with the left, up, down, right keys in the default layers?
